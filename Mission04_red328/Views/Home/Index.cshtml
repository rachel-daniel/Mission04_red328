<p>My name is Rachel and I love to travel! Here's a picture of me at Stonehenge during the IS study abroad in spring 2022.</p>
<p>I'm excited to really solidify OOP skills this semester and get more practice building web apps. I also hope to feel more comfortable with a strongly typed language and feel more confident in my ability to learn any new langauge that a job might require.</p>
<h4>Top 3 Jobs I'm interested in pursuing post-graduation (in no particular order):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Business Intelligence Analyst</li>
    <li>Technological Risk Consultant</li>
    <li>Independent Contractor/Consultant/Entrepreneur</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This is what I <i>think</i> I'm interested in right now, but I'm excited for my internship to gain more industry experience</p>
